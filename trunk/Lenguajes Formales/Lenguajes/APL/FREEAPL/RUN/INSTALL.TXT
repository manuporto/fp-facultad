       Installation instructions for FreeAPL for Windows

       The FreeAPL for Windows diskette should contain the following files:
           INSTALL.BAT
           FREEAPL.EXE
           FREEAPL.HLP
           AUXFNS.C
           AUXFNS.DLL
           CHART.DLL
           APLFIX.FON
           APL2741.TTF
           APL2741.FOT
           FREEAPL.INI
           INSTALL.TXT (This file)

       The installation takes place as follows:

       1. Put the FreeAPL diskette in drive A:

       2. Change drive A: to current drive.

       3. Type INSTALL and press <Enter>.

       INSTALL 1) makes directory C:\FREEAPL, and its subdirectories WS
       and FUN, 2) copies files FREEAPL.EXE, FREEAPL.HLP, APLFIX.FON,
       AUXFNS.*, CHART.DLL and INSTALL.TXT to it, 3) copies utility
       and demo workspaces from the directory A:\WS to C:\FREEAPL\WS,
       and 4) copies file FREEAPL.INI to C:\WINDOWS.

       If you want to install FreeAPL to another drive/directory, files
       INSTALL.BAT and FREEAPL.INI must be changed accordingly.

       The default screen font is "APLfix" and the default printer font is
       "Courier". You can change the defaults by adding to the FREEAPL.INI
       file the lines
       		screenfont=fontname
       		screenfontsize=<fontsize>
       		printerfont=fontname
       		printerfontsize=<fontsize>
       where fontnames and fontsizes may be different.

       If you have Windows 3.1 (or later), then you can use Adrian Smith's
       APL2741, and copy files APL2741.TTF and APL2741.FOT to your Windows
       directory. This enables printing of APL characters, if you have a
       printer that supports TrueType.

       Lastly, you should install the beautiful red apple of FreeAPL to
       your Program Manager!
